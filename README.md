dotfiler â€” the ultimate solution for managing dotfiles!
=======================================================

It was inspired by [Zach Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and
[homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick), but was made according KISS priciple.

There is only one command in dotfiler: `dot update`.

Installation

1. Clone this project somewhere like `$HOME/.dotfiles` and add `$HOME/.dotfiles/bin` into
your `PATH`.
2. Then clone some config files into the `$HOME/.dotfiles` .
3. Run `dot update` to make all necessary symlinks.
4. Have a profit!
